MS2minimize is a simple application that sits in the system tray by the time. When the icon is clicked, it minimizes MS2 - specifically when ms2 is in fullscreen mode and can't be minimized normally. 

This project was made using code::blocks.

See the [Release section](https://github.com/katlox/ms2minimize/releases) to download compiled binaries.
